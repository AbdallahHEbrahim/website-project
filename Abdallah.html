          <h2 style="color: darkslategray;">Artificial intelligence (AI)</h2>
           <p>the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly
              associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing
              systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason,
               discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s,
                it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example,
                 discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. </p>

          <P>All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, 
            while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence.
             What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus.</P>
